FIWARE - ROS 2 bridge
=====================

An interesting use case is the one of bringing information coming from the *ROS 2* world into the *FIWARE* ecosystem,
so that it can be used to translate information coming from physically operated *ROS 2* robots
into its *FIWARE's* digital twin models.

The steps described below aim to provide an easy way to translate the information coming from a *ROS 2* publisher
into the *FIWARE’s Orion Context Broker*; and viceversa.

Requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^

To prepare the deployment and setup the environment, you need to have *eProsima Integration Service* correctly
installed in your system.
To do so, please follow the steps delineated in the :ref:`installation` section.

Also, to get this example working, the following requirements must be met:

* Having **ROS 2** (*Foxy* or superior) installed, with the :code:`talker-listener` example working.

* Having the **ROS 2 System Handle** installed. You can download it from the
  `ROS2-SH dedicated repository <https://github.com/eProsima/ROS2-SH>`_ into the :code:`is-workspace`
  where you have *eProsima Integration Service* installed:

  .. code-block:: bash

      cd ~/is-workspace
      git clone https://github.com/eProsima/ROS2-SH.git src/ROS2-SH

* Having a **FIWARE’s Context Broker** correctly set up. To do so:
  * Set up a *MongoDB* database image:

    .. code-block:: bash

      docker run --rm --name mongodb -d mongo:3.4

  * Create a container for the *FIWARE’s Orion Context Broker*, linked to the previously created *MongoDB* docker:

    .. code-block:: bash

      docker run --rm -d --name orion1 --link mongodb:mongodb -p 1026:1026 fiware/orion -dbhost mongodb

  It is very important to retrieve the :code:`fiware/orion` docker container IP, because it will be later placed
  in the *Integration Service YAML* configuration file. To do so, simply check the output of the following command:

  .. code-block:: bash

    ifconfig docker0 | grep “inet “

* Having the **FIWARE System Handle** installed. You can download it from the
  `FIWARE-SH dedicated repository <https://github.com/eProsima/FIWARE-SH>`_ into the :code:`is-workspace`
  where you have *eProsima Integration Service* installed:

  .. code-block:: bash

    cd ~/dds-is-workspace
    git clone https://github.com/eProsima/FIWARE-SH.git src/FIWARE-SH

After you have everything correctly installed, build the packages by running:

.. code-block:: bash

  colcon build

Deployment
^^^^^^^^^^

Below we explain how to deploy an example of this communication in both directions allowed.

ROS 2 pub to FIWARE
-----------------------

To enable communication from *ROS 2* to *FIWARE*, open two terminals:

* In the first terminal, go to the :code:`is-workspace` folder, source the *ROS 2* and local installations, and execute
  *eProsima Integration Service* with the :code:`integration-service` command followed by the
  `ros2_fiware__helloworld.yaml <https://github.com/eProsima/Integration-Service/blob/main/examples/basic/ros2_fiware__helloworld.yaml>`_
  configuration file located in the :code:`src/Integration-Service/examples/basic` folder.

  .. important::

    **Please notice** that the *YAML* may have a different IP address for the :code:`host` file
    that the one you retrieved from your docker container bridge, if so, replace it properly.
    From now on, in this example, the host will be located at IP address :code:`172.17.0.1`:

  .. code-block:: bash

      cd ~/is-workspace
      source /opt/ros/$<ROS2_DISTRO>/setup.bash
      source install/setup.bash
      integration-service src/Integration-Service/examples/basic/ros2_fiware__helloworld.yaml

* In the second terminal, source the *ROS 2* installation and launch the *ROS 2* :code:`pub`:

  .. code-block:: bash

      source /opt/ros/$<ROS2_DISTRO>/setup.bash
      ros2 topic pub /hello_fiware std_msgs/msg/String "{data: Hello FIWARE}"

Now, in your browser, go to `http://172.17.0.1:1026/v2/entities <http://172.17.0.1:1026/v2/entities>`_.
You should see a context broker entity named **hello_fiware**.
Now, if you press `F5` in the browser, you should see that the entity is updated with the ROS provided values.


FIWARE to ROS 2 echo
-----------------------

To enable communication from *FIWARE* to *ROS 2*, open three terminals:

* In the first terminal, go to the :code:`is-workspace` folder, source the *ROS 2* and local installations,
  and execute *eProsima Integration Service* with the :code:`integration-service` command followed by the
  `ros2_fiware__helloworld.yaml <https://github.com/eProsima/Integration-Service/blob/main/examples/basic/ros2_fiware__helloworld.yaml>`_
  configuration file located in the :code:`src/Integration-Service/examples/basic` folder.

  .. important::

    **Please notice** that the *YAML* may have a different IP address for the :code:`host` file
    that the one you retrieved from your docker container bridge, if so, replace it properly.
    From now on, in this example, the host will be located at IP address :code:`172.17.0.1`:

  .. code-block:: bash

      cd ~/is-workspace
      source /opt/ros/$<ROS2_DISTRO>/setup.bash
      source install/setup.bash
      integration-service src/Integration-Service/examples/basic/ros2_fiware__helloworld.yaml

* In the second terminal, create the corresponding entities in the *FIWARE’s Context Broker*:

  .. code-block:: json

    curl 172.17.0.1:1026/v2/entities -s -S -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d @- <<EOF
    {
        "id": "hello_ros2",
        "type": "HelloWorld",
        "data": {
            "value": "",
            "type": "String"
        }
    }
    EOF

Now, in your browser, go to `http://172.17.0.1:1026/v2/entities <http://172.17.0.1:1026/v2/entities>`_.
You should see the context broker entity named **hello_fiware** previously created.

* In the third terminal, source the *ROS 2* installation and launch the *ROS 2* :code:`echo`:

  .. code-block:: bash

      source /opt/ros/$<ROS2_DISTRO>/setup.bash
      ros2 topic echo /hello_ros2

* Again in the second terminal, update the *FIWARE* entity hosted in the *Context Broker*:

  .. code-block:: json

    curl 172.17.0.1:1026/v2/entities/hello_ros2/attrs?type=HelloWorld -s -S -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -X PUT -d @- <<EOF
    {
        "data": {
            "value": "Hello, ROS 2",
            "type": "String"
        }
    }
    EOF

You should see the message echoed in the ROS 2 terminal.
